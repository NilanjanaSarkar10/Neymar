<h3>What other players think about Brazil's favorite No.10 at the moment?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cafu said - "Today, technically, nobody can beat Neymar. Not even Messi, although I am a fan of him. But he does not surpass him in terms of technical quality." </li>
                    <li>“I like Neymar a lot. He is a bit like me. He had some difficulties in getting used to his new environment at first, but I knew that he was going to succeed.
                        – Cristiano Ronaldo on Neymar</li>
                        <li>“Neymar is a great player who can make the difference”
                            – Sergio Ramos quote about Neymar</li>
                            <li>“It’s been clear ever since he signed for Brazilian team Santos at 17 that Neymar is an outstanding talent, a once-in-a-generation type of footballer who has fans on their feet whenever he gets the ball. I’ve always been struck by his humility. He’s respectful and wants to learn, which he proved when he arrived at Barcelona in 2013 to play alongside some of the game’s biggest stars.
                                – David Beckham</li>
                                <li>“One of the best young players. He will contribute a lot, he’s a player with outstanding talent and quality. He can unsettle opponents, score goals and give spectacular performances at a club which is ideal to continue growing.”
                                    – Andres Iniesta on Neymar when he joined Barcelona</li>
                                    <li>“Certainly, most people I speak to speak highly of the boy. When I had Anderson at United, he spoke volumes about the boy’s ability. So hopefully he’ll be the next one who’ll produce the type of talent we see in Messi and Ronaldo.”
                                        – Sir Alex Ferguson</li>
                                        <li>“Some people like his style, others don’t. I can understand that his opponents don’t like it when he fools about too much on the pitch, but the way he plays certainly brings a lot of spectacle. The fans love players like Neymar.”
                                            – Zidane labels Neymar as a crowd pleaser</li>
                                            <li>“He is ready to deal with Messi and Cristiano. For me he should’ve been among the nominees for FIFA The Best award. Neymar is doing things in Barcelona that remind me of the early Messi’s years.”
                                                – Diego Maradona quotes about Neymar</li>
                                                <li>“When I am asked about Messi and Cristiano I say that Neymar is the best for me. It is not just for his goals, but for the ease with which he plays and the confidence he has. Neymar is going to have a Ballon d’Or in one or two years because he is going to deserve it.”
                                                    – Roberto Carlos on Neymar quotes</li>
